# Casterlabs-AIO-Egg
 
This is the Casterlabs AIO Egg for Pterodactyl. We use this for our API services (Pterodactyl makes life a lot easier).

## Eggs

In this nest, you'll find eggs for:
 - Debian Buster: Java 8 (OpenJDK), NodeJS 16, and Go 1.18 ((Docker repository)[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/e3ndr/java8-node16-go1_18])

If you want a different configuration, create an (issue)[/issues] and we'll get on it. :^)

## Usage

To use, just fill out the `COMMAND` variable with whatever command you want executed (e.g `java -jar example.jar` or `node example.mjs`).
